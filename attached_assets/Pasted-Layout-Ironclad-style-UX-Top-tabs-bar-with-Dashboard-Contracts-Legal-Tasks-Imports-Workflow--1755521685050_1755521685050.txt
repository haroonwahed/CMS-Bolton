Layout (Ironclad-style UX)

Top tabs bar with: Dashboard, Contracts, Legal Tasks, Imports, Workflow Designer, Insights, Obligations, Entities.

Left sidebar with sections and counts:

Views: Starred, All

Repository: Draft, Internal Review, Negotiation, Signature, Executed, Upcoming deadlines, Duplicates, Updated predictions

Workflows: In progress, Assigned to me, Needs my signature, Owned by me

Main content:

Header: “All Contracts” + “New Contract” button (accent style).

Filter chips row (Ironclad pattern): Current Status, Type, Counterparty, People, Date; chips are toggles with filled state when active.

Repository list: rows with

left: contract title + counterparty (truncate)

right: status badge (Draft, Active, Inactive, Unverified) and a secondary hint (e.g., Review, Expiring • 60d).

Pagination bottom-right (“Prev/Next”), summary text “1–50 of N contracts”.

3) Components (use shadcn/ui style but hand-rolled with Tailwind)

Create reusable components in /src/components:

TopTabs.tsx, Sidebar.tsx, Chip.tsx, Badge.tsx, Button.tsx, SearchInput.tsx, Toolbar.tsx, ListRow.tsx, Pagination.tsx, KPI.tsx.

Button styles: primary (blue), accent (yellow), ghost, outline.

Badge palette:

Draft: bg #eef2ff, text #1e40af

Active: bg #e6f6ee, text #0f766e

Inactive: bg #f3f4f6, text #4b5563

Unverified: bg #fff7dc, text #92400e

4) Styling details (Bolton look)

Plenty of white space, light gray separators, rounded-xl cards, images/illustrations use rounded-2xl masks.

Primary underlines for active tabs (thin 2px, primary-500).

Hover states: subtle translate-y-[1px] and shadow-md for clickable cards.

Page background uses bg-[var(--color-bg)].

5) Interactions

Chips toggle and update the list (local mock state).

Search input debounces and filters mock data.

Sidebar counts update based on filters.

Keep code ready to swap to real API later (types + RepositoryService.ts with mock data).

6) Scaffolding

Create pages: /contracts (repository), /dashboard (KPI cards + links), /legal-tasks.

Default route → /contracts.

Provide sample mock data (20–30 contracts) with varied statuses and hints (e.g., “Review”, “Expiring • 60d”).

7) Deliverables

Tailwind configured with the Bolton-themed palette (via CSS vars).

A polished UI that visually reads like Bolton (blue/yellow/airy surfaces/rounded corners) but behaves like Ironclad (tabs, sidebar repo, chips, badges, list, pagination).

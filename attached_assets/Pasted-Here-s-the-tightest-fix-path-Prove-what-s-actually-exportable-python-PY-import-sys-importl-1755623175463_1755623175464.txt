Here’s the tightest fix path:

Prove what’s actually exportable

python - <<'PY'
import sys, importlib
sys.path.append("/home/runner/workspace")
m = importlib.import_module("contracts.views")
print("exports:", [n for n in dir(m) if n.endswith("View")])
PY


If SignUpView / ContractListView aren’t in that printout, your imports will fail.

Match imports to reality

If everything is in a single file:

# contracts/urls.py
from .views import SignUpView, ContractListView


If you split them:

from .views.auth import SignUpView
from .views.contracts import ContractListView


If you did split into a package, re-export (cleanest)

# contracts/views/__init__.py
from .auth import SignUpView
from .contracts import ContractListView
__all__ = ["SignUpView", "ContractListView"]


Now from .views import SignUpView, ContractListView works again.

If the views don’t exist yet, stub them

# contracts/views.py
from django.contrib.auth.forms import UserCreationForm
from django.urls import reverse_lazy
from django.views.generic import CreateView, ListView
from .models import Contract

class SignUpView(CreateView):
    form_class = UserCreationForm
    template_name = "registration/signup.html"
    success_url = reverse_lazy("login")

class ContractListView(ListView):
    model = Contract
    template_name = "contracts/contract_list.html"
    context_object_name = "contracts"


Namespace must match

# contracts/urls.py
app_name = "contracts"   # required because you include(..., namespace="contracts")


Kill circulars
Make sure contracts/views.py (or submodules) never import contracts.urls. Views import models/forms/utils only.

Replit hygiene

# clear stale bytecode & restart the repl
find . -type d -name "__pycache__" -prune -exec rm -rf {} +


Then stop/start the server. Replit’s autoreloader sometimes latches onto old paths.

Sanity grep for naming typos

grep -R "class .*SignUpView" -n contracts
grep -R "class .*ContractListView" -n contracts


Fix SignupView vs SignUpView, ContractsListView vs ContractListView, etc.

Basics

contracts in INSTALLED_APPS.

If you reference registration/signup.html or contracts/contract_list.html, make those templates exist.
